- Users who contribute to the tune of 3million CRUDE.LVRG tokens become eligible for rewards.
- 33.33% the funds gotten are locked in the CRUDE.BTSP Liquidity Pool Contract.
- 33.33% is converted to bitCNY and stored in the fbn3113104450 reserve wallet.
- all contract funds for CRUDE.LVRG are reflected on the crude-leverage wallet.
- The profits gotten from the pool share distribution will then be used to buy back CRUDE.LVRG from the market.
- This in-turn will reduce the yearly budget supply to holders and increase the value of the token via its locked contract.
