# How it works
Leveraged tokens are innovative assets that can give you leveraged exposure to cryptocurrency markets, without all the nuts and bolts of managing a leveraged position.
CRUDE.LVRG is a 5x long/Short BTS token that follows the weekly price change of bitshares.  For every 1% BTS goes up in a day, CLVRG goes up 5%; for every 1% BTS goes down, CLVRG goes down 5%.
 As a rule of thumb CRUDE.LVRG holders have the long position in BTS and the short positon in CRUDE.NGN and viseversa.
 * A sale of the token (Shorting) indicates a close of position.
# ODDS
CRUDE.LVRG supply works on a 1:5 odd, What this means is that to open a postion (go long/buy) freshly issued coins are done at 20% of the face value
For example to open a 1000CRUDE.LVRG position (to issue 1000CLVRG) the buyer would be required to pay 5000BTS or its equivalent in stablecoin, assuming the initial rate was 1BTS.
The Resulting BTS is used to open a postion against CNGN starting at 2200x the rate i.e 2200BTS/CNGN (should BTS drop by 20% long postions are assumed to be liquidated, to maintain price the 5000BTS will then be used to buy the coin starting at almost 15000BTS/CLVRG).



# Disclaimers
None of this is investment advice.
Much of the below analysis ignores any difference between futures and spot prices, and ignores the effects of fees.
It also ignores slippage incurred while rebalancing, and generally assumes that all transactions happened at theoretical prices rather.
While your account's holding of a leveraged token cannot be liquidated, the leveraged token itself theoretically could be.
Leveraged tokens greatly reduce the risk of liquidation but cannot make it fully impossible; if markets instantaneously gap down 20%, there is nothing that can stop the +5x leveraged position held by the leveraged token from getting liquidated.
In addition, while leveraged tokens attempt to avoid getting liquidated, this does not prevent them from being able to suffer heavy losses.
Leveraged tokens can have unintuitive edge cases.
While this does generally describe how Leveraged Tokens work, it contains approximations and should not be taken as precise.
Users should trade Leveraged Tokens at their own risk.
Leveraged tokens, like the rest of FTX, are not being offered to US users.
