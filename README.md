# How it works
Leveraged tokens are innovative assets that can give you leveraged exposure to cryptocurrency markets, without all the nuts and bolts of managing a leveraged position.
CRUDE.LVRG is a 5x long/Short BTS token that follows the weekly price change of bitshares.  For every 1% BTS goes up in a day, CLVRG goes up 5%; for every 1% BTS goes down, CLVRG goes down 5%.
 As a rule of thumb CRUDE.LVRG holders have the long position in BTS and the short positon in CRUDE.NGN and viseversa.
 * A sale of the token (Shorting) indicates a close of position.
 * Never Sell CLVRG for BTS i.e CLVRG/BTS is forbidden, you may lose money by doing so, only sell for CNGN....

# Disclaimers
None of this is investment advice.
Much of the below analysis ignores any difference between futures and spot prices, and ignores the effects of fees.
It also ignores slippage incurred while rebalancing, and generally assumes that all transactions happened at theoretical prices rather.
While your account's holding of a leveraged token cannot be liquidated, the leveraged token itself theoretically could be.
Leveraged tokens greatly reduce the risk of liquidation but cannot make it fully impossible; if markets instantaneously gap down 20%, there is nothing that can stop the +5x leveraged position held by the leveraged token from getting liquidated.
In addition, while leveraged tokens attempt to avoid getting liquidated, this does not prevent them from being able to suffer heavy losses.
Leveraged tokens can have unintuitive edge cases.
While this does generally describe how Leveraged Tokens work, it contains approximations and should not be taken as precise.
Users should trade Leveraged Tokens at their own risk.
Leveraged tokens, like the rest of FTX, are not being offered to US users.
